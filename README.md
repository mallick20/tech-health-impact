# 📊 Tech Use & Mental Health Analysis

This project investigates the relationship between **technology usage**—including internet access and computer use—and **mental/psychological health outcomes** among individuals in the United States.

## 🧠 Project Overview

With growing dependence on digital technology, it is essential to understand how varying levels of technology access and use may influence mental well-being. This study brings together two nationally representative datasets to explore potential associations:

- **NTIA Internet Use Survey**: Captures individual- and household-level data on internet and computer usage.
- **NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health)**: Provides detailed insights into mental health conditions, behavioral patterns.

## 🔍 Goal

We aim to merge and analyze data from both surveys to examine how different levels and forms of technology engagement relate to reported levels of psychological stress, anxiety, depression, and other indicators of mental health.
